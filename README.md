# morse-translator

This is a simple Morse code translator - along with a step-by-step guide in a Jupyter Notebook - containing encoding and decoding functions, testing suites for both, and a very basic GUI created using tkinter (my first time using this package!)

You can either run it as a Jupyter Notebook, or run the file in IDLE to access the GUI directly.
